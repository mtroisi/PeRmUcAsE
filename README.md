# PeRmUcAsE
PeRmUcAsE, a name derived from the words 'permutation' and 'case', is a small program to generate all possible character case permutations given an input string. Why was this program made? Out of spite.

## Parameters
`String`: Required parameter to use as the input string. The program will use that and generate each permutation of uppercase and lowercase characters.
